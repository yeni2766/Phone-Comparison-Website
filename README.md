# Phone-Comparison-Website
This was a project completed during my time in university to create a product comparison website to help users decide on the best phone option for them. The website uses visualizations to create a user journey and display the specifications of the different products.

Challenges
The main challenge of this project was coding the layout to respond and be viewed properly on both desktop and mobile devices. This was solved by using Bootstrap to create a side-by-side layout for desktop users and an up-and-down layout for mobile users.
Another challenge was implementing interactivity to fulfill website principles. To solve this, I created a search bar for users to search for a phone and view the data in real time. I had to learn AJAX to accomplish this, and my previous experience with PHP enabled me to work with the backend aspect of the project.

# Skills Used

- Bootstrap for responsive design
- AJAX for real-time data fetching and display
= PHP for backend development

Overall, this project was much easier compared to my previous project as my knowledge of programming languages had improved significantly. I was able to translate my ideas into code successfully and create a functioning product comparison website.

# Improvements

Given the chance to improve this project, I would focus on enhancing the user experience by adding more filters and sorting options to the comparison page. Additionally, I would add more product categories to make the website more versatile and cater to a wider range of user needs.
